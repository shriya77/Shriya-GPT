# ShriyaGPT

**A portfolio that answers back.**

ShriyaGPT is a one-page, interactive portfolio built with React and Vite that lets people *ask questions* instead of scrolling. It’s designed to showcase my projects, experience, and thinking through a conversational interface, backed by real data and proof.

This isn’t a chatbot demo or a generic portfolio template. It’s a living interface over my work.
